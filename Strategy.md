# Problem

* We have two different behaviors (methods): (a) Sorting a list of objects, (b) Displaying a list of objects.
* Sort behavior can be implemented using different algorithms with different run-time complexities.
* Display behavior can be implemented showing a list either in natural order or in reverse order.
* We have an "Author" class that should have both Sort behavior and Display behavior.
* An Author object should be able to implement these two behaviors with different implementations.


# Solution

* Pull out the two behaviors from the Author class and put them in two hierarchies of behaviors (i.e. interfaces and concrete implementations).
* Create two methods inside the Author class that identify the concrete implementation of the two behaviors and return the reference to the behaviors as objects.
* Use the identified objects inside the Author class to call the concrete implementation of the expected behaviors.
